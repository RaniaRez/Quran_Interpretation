PROPHET IBRAHIM
- Prophet Ibrahim (as) was born in the Kingdom of Babylon which was the capital city of Babylonia, a kingdom in ancient Mesopotamia, between the 18th and 6th centuries BC. Its ruins are located in what we’d refer to as modern day Iraq.
- Ibrahim (AS) was surrounded by people who worshipped idols as well as the sun, the moon, the stars and human kings. He thought about each of these in turn and none of them made sense. He asked questions to his father and to his people. They were not able to give him the answers he needed. Allah guided him to the worship of God alone.

PROPHET SALIH
- The story of Salih is linked to the story of the She-Camel of God, which was the gift given by God to the people of Thamud when they desired a miracle to confirm that Salih was truly a prophet.
- Salih is the prophet who prophesied to the tribe of Thamudin ancient Arabia.
- Thamud hated the camel and decided to remove it from their lives and killed it. And then Allah sent down upon them a severe punishment.
- Salih’s story teaches us that we should not put God to the test, asking for signs and proofs from Him, when the whole of creation is surely one great sign of His goodness to the world.

HONESTY
- Allah SWT ordered us to always be honest and say the truth whatever the situation is.
- Honesty and truthfulness are one of the key fundamental virtues of Islam.
- Speaking the truth leads directly to Paradise. Allah SWT said: “This is the Day when ˹only˺ the faithful will benefit from their faithfulness. Theirs are Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is the ultimate triumph [5:119]”

KINDNESS
- Kindness and gentleness are qualities for which Allah has set aside a special reward.
- One Hadith quotes Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) as saying: “A good deed done to an animal is as meritorious as a good deed done to a human being, while an act of cruelty to an animal is as bad as an act of cruelty to a human being.”
- Giving a helping hand to others when they need it is one of the most beautiful manifestations of kindness in islam.

SURAH AL FATIHA
- Al-Fatihah literally means The Opening because the Qur’an opens with it.
- It is recited in every unit of the prayer and is a summary of the entire Qur'an.
- In this Surah is the supplication to cure the Muslim’s heart from the diseases of rejection, ignorance, and misguidance. 

MIRACLE OF THE SKY
- The scientists knew that the sky was a protected ceiling only in the 20th century.
- The verse "And We have made the sky a well-protected canopy, still they turn away from its signs" [21:32] explicitly shows that Allah is saying that he made the sky as a protective ceiling.

MIRACLE OF THE MOUNTAINS
- Mountains are indeed beautiful but one of the most important features of them is to hold down the earth.
- The verse "And We placed firm mountains on earth lest it should sway with them,30 and We made wide paths, in them that they may find their way." [21:31] explicitly shows that Allah is saying that he made the mountains to hold down the earth.

MARRIAGE
- The Quran establishes marriage as a highly recommended act, conveyed as a priority. 
- In islam, marriage is more than a partnerships. Spouses should be garments for one another.
- Surah An-nisa primarily addresses the mutual rights of human beings and foundations for family life.

ZAKAT
- Zakat is one of the five pillars of Islam, making it an obligatory act of worship for all Muslims who meet certain eligibility criteria.
- Zakat serves as a way to purify our hearts and enriche the power of charity.

SALAT 
- Salat, or the Contact Prayer in English, provides the main nourishment for our souls.
- The Salah is not just a commandment, it’s more than that. It serves as a spiritual nourishment and reinforces the connection with Allah.

HAJJ
- Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, holds profound significance in Islam, being one of the five pillars of the faith.
- Hajj is not merely a physical journey but a spiritual one as well.
