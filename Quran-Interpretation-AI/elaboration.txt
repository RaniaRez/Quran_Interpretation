STORY OF IBRAHIM
Ibrahim (AS) was a Prophet, born in Babylonia, which is modern- day Iraq. He was born to a father who made idols that his people worshipped. He went through a path of discovering Allah, the One True God and rejecting the worship of idols. He was the father of nations, and from his lineage, came the Prophets of the monotheistic religions. He, along with his son Ismail, built the Kaaba which is also called ‘Bayt ullah’, the house of God.
His father Aazar built Idols and worshiped them, he did not respond to him and remained in a state of arrogance and denial, which prompted our Prophet  Ibrahim to destroy all the idols they worshiped except for the biggest idol among them. When his people saw the destroyed idols they knew that Prophet Ibrahim was the one who did it.
The people of our Prophet  Ibrahim wanted to take revenge on him, so they decided to throw him into the fires to burn him, but Allah saved him from this fire, as Allah said.

STORY OF SALIH
Allah sent our Prophet Saleh, peace be upon him, to invite his people to worship Allah alone, and they are the people of Thamud who lived in the Al-Hijr area between Tabuk and Hijaz. They worshiped idols at the time, and when our Prophet  Saleh called them, only a few responded to him.
Our Prophet  Saleh kept calling those who disbelieved in him repeatedly, and he asked him to bring them a miracle to believe what they were calling to. Most of them are infidels.
The group that disbelieved met and killed the she-camel, so our Prophet Saleh, peace be upon him, warned them of the punishment that they would meet after three days, but they did not respond to him and mocked him, and Allah punished them with their destruction by sending stones on them.

HONSETY
Honesty is defined as saying the truth without changing it. It means to do what you say and that all your deeds are identical to all your sayings. Honesty and truthfulness are considered the weapons of the believers in the battle against the falsehood on earth. They are the merits of those who believe in Allah (SWT) as the only God to be worshipped and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.
Honesty always gives strength, reassurance, and self-confidence to the honest person, unlike the liar who always feels afraid of being disclosed and despised by people when they find out his/her reality.
All of the prophets, peace and blessings be upon them, were truthful and honest people whom Allah praised for their honesty.

KINDNESS
Our prophet Mohamed said “Whoever is kind, Allah will be kind to him; therefore be kind to man on the earth. He who is in heaven will show mercy on you”(Abu Daud: Tirmidhi) and also said: “Kindness is not to be found in anything but that it adds to its beauty and it is not withdrawn from anything but it makes it defective.” (Sahih Muslim)
Kindness means to show care, concern and consideration for both ourselves and those with whom we share the world with. It manifests as a soothing smile, a warm hug, or a helpful hand just when we need it most or perhaps when we least expect it. 
Kindness and gentleness are qualities for which Allah has set aside a special reward. Anyone who possesses kindness and gentleness has received their fair share of goodness because these qualities are intrinsically wonderful. One of the most cherished and worshiped traits of a good character is kindness. 

SURAH AL FATIHA
Al-Fatihah literally means The Opening because the Qur’an opens with it. It is the first chapter (surah) of the Qur’an and is considered its ‘greatest surah’. It is seen to be a precise table of contents of the Qur’anic message because some scholars of exegesis have stated that this chapter is a summary of the whole Qur’an. Its seven verses are regularly recited at the start of every unit (rak’ah) of the prayer and this is why one of its names is The Seven Oft Repeated Verses. The ritual five daily prayers without it are considered invalid. It has other names as well, such as, the Mother of the Book, The Cure, The Commendation (Hamd), and others.
In this chapter is the supplication to cure the Muslim’s heart from the diseases of rejection, ignorance, and misguidance. The chapter shows that the greatest blessing is the blessing of Islam. Therefore, whoever knows the truth and followed it, he will be most deserving of the straight path. There is no doubt that the companions of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) are the most deserving of the people after the prophets of the straight path. The last verse indicates their great status because Allah bestowed favor upon them, may Allah be pleased with them all.
It is recommended for the reader to say after reciting Al-Fatiha “Ameen“. It means, O’ Allah answer my supplication. The word Ameen is not one of the verses of Al-Fatiha by the consensus of the scholars and this is why they do not write it in the Qur’an.

MIRACLE OF THE SKY
Scientists did not know that the sky was a protected ceiling until the 20th century.
Allah SWT says in the Quran, [21:31].
The sky is not only beautiful to look at, but it also plays an important role in our survival. The Sun radiates energy in different wavelengths – the shorter the wavelength, the greater the potential harm. Some of this energy, however, is required for crucial functions such as photosynthesis in the plants and production of Vitamin D in human beings.
Allah SWT designed a mechanism that ensures only harmless rays reached the Earth. This mechanism is what we know as the ‘ozone layer’. The scientists discovered this layer in the year 1913.
That is not all. The atmosphere around us maintains a certain temperature suitable for our living. In absence of this, the temperature would drop down to -270°C and we would freeze to death.
The sky is our protective covering which prevents the celestial bodies from falling on us. Imagine if there was no sky and the stars and the sun were not commanded by Allah SWT to stay at their places, what would have happened? Things would have been falling over our heads and everyday life would have become problematic.

MIRACLE OF THE MOUNTAINS
Allah SWT says [21:31]
The Earth that we live on is in a constant state of motion. We do not feel it because Allah placed gigantic mountains to hold it down. This fact was unknown until the geologists discovered that mountains have roots deep under the surface of the ground. These roots clench different plates of the Earth like a peg or an anchor to control and prevent it from shaking.
The miracles of the Quran teach us to appreciate the artistry of Allah and acknowledge the things that He has done for us to make our survival possible.
Imagine if there were no mountains, how we would have walked on this Earth when it was constantly shaking? Ask the people who have lived through tremors or aftershocks after an earthquake. There is a constant fear.\

MARRIAGE
The Quran is full of verses that talks about different aspects of marriage. Let’s explore some of them together!
The Quran establishes marriage as a highly recommended act, conveyed as a priority. This verse endorses marriage to each and every person who is single, specifically mentioning the quality of being righteous. This refers to not only having the correct attitude and mindset, but also having the capabilities necessary to fulfil the responsibilities of marriage. This verse teaches that wealth should not be considered a source of anxiety nor a barrier to marriage. In some cases one may find that a suitor is rejected on the basis of wealth and that some families prevent their children from seeking marriage unless a particular income is earned. However, the character of a potential spouse is more enduring than wealth.
The fourth chapter of the Quran, surah an-Nisa, addresses the mutual rights of human beings as well as lays the foundation for a sound family life. The opening verse urges mankind to acknowledge that all human beings share the same roots as descendants of Prophet Adam and his wife Eve (or Hawa), may Allah be pleased with them. This conveys the connection that exists between all people due to sharing a common ancestor, the first male and female. This Quran verse about marriage signifies the bond between man and woman, as spouses, and as beings created for each other.
This particular Quranic verse about marriage describes spouses as clothing or garments. In this respect, both husband and wife are required to play the same role in the relationship. The function of a garment is to conceal and protect, therefore, spouses serve as each other’s protection and shelter. If one is lacking in an aspect, it is the duty of the other to ensure that this is not exposed to the elements i.e. others outside the marriage.
Being like garments to each other means being present, having each other’s back. If one spouse is feeling vulnerable, the other spouse is at the ready to wrap their partner in comfort and support. Another point that this verse addresses is the importance of spending quality time and fulfilling each other’s rights. Spouses should be active in striving to ensure that the marriage is a place of trust and confidence. The metaphor of spouses as clothing paints a vivid picture of the bond and intimacy that underscores a healthy relationship.

ZAKAT
Zakat is one of the five pillars of Islam, making it an obligatory act of worship for all Muslims who meet certain eligibility criteria.
This obligation is not just a spiritual duty but also a social contract, deeply rooted in Islamic teachings and the Quran. Let’s explore some verses.
[2:110]
This emphasizes the fundamental practices that every Muslim should adhere to. The verse serves as a reminder of the integral role that both Salah (prayer) and Zakat (charity) play in a Muslim’s life.
This verse underscores the importance of establishing regular prayers and giving Zakat as acts of worship. The Verse also assures believers that their good deeds are not in vain; Allah is fully aware of them and they will find their rewards with Him.
[9:103]
This verse provides guidance specifically to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) on how to utilize the wealth of the community for the greater good. It outlines the purifying and enriching power of charity.
The verse highlights the transformative power of Zakat, not just as a financial obligation but as a means to purify one’s wealth and soul. It also emphasizes the role of the Prophet’s blessings in providing reassurance to the believers.
The following Hadith, narrated by both Bukhari and Muslims, lays down the foundational pillars upon which Islam is built. It encapsulates the essence of being a Muslim and outlines the core practices that define Islamic faith.
“The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) said: “Islam was built on five pillars: To attest that there is no deity but Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, perform Salah,  pay the Zakat, make the pilgrimage to the House (Hajj), and Sawm in Ramadan.” (Bukhari, Muslim).
The Hadith serves as a comprehensive guide to the basic tenets of Islam, highlighting the importance of Zakat alongside other pillars like Salah, Hajj, and Sawm. It reiterates that Zakat is not just a charitable act but a fundamental pillar that supports the structure of Islamic faith.

SALAH
Salat, or the Contact Prayer in English, provides the main nourishment for our souls. That makes sense, since God (Allah in transliterated Arabic) specifies it be prayed throughout the day. Each of the five prayers has a range of time within which we Muslims (Submitters in English) can pray it. Thus, the prayers help us keep God in mind throughout the whole day. Perhaps Salat’s critical importance to our souls gives it the distinction of being one of the first “pillars of Islam”. The following verse demonstrates its importance for us:
This verse emphasizes the impact of Salat on the soul and how it serves as a means of spiritual nourishment. The act of prayer is not just a physical ritual; it is a connection between the worshipper and the Divine. By praying throughout the day, we, as muslims are reminded of our continuous connection with Allah.
The mention of Salat as one of the first "pillars of Islam" is reinforced by this verse. It highlights the importance of prayer as a foundational aspect of the Islamic faith. Just as pillars provide structural support to a building, Salat serves as a fundamental support for the spiritual structure of a Muslim's life, reinforcing the connection with Allah.
This verse may emphasize the instructional aspect of Salat, indicating that through prayer, believers receive guidance and direction in their lives. The act of bowing down in prayer symbolizes submission and humility before God. Salat, therefore, becomes a transformative practice, shaping the character and conduct of the individual in alignment with Islamic principles.
